# Risky Driving Behavior Analysis â€“ Big Data Project

This project analyzes risky driving behavior acro U.S. cities using vehicle sensor event data, processed through Hive, and visualized using Tableau. The objective is to identify patterns associated with high driver risk and present them in a clean, interactive dashboard.

## Project Highlights

- City-wise analysis of risky vs. safe zones
- Truck model-based event correlation
- Cluster-based driver risk segmentation (K-Means)
- Key event triggers: unsafe following distance, lane departure
- Tableau dashboard for dynamic visual analysis
